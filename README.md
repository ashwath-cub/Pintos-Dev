Pintos kernel development in line with requirements in : http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1

I found that the installation requirements described are rather stale. 
I used instructions as described in: https://youtu.be/3p2lUXH2fxU?si=QTW4ybLPWyZeX8sJ

So far this has just the first two projects: Threads and Userprograms.
No code is borrowed. 
Wait/Exit logic around resource allocation and release is used from pseudocode in UC Berkley's HW2 CS162-FA15 and is attributed as such in the source.

Diffs can be obtained in the two releases.

Thanks!
